This Paper plugin adds many new types of TNT to the game.
TNT can have one or more "addons" that modify the TNT behavior.

Addons can be added to TNT by crafting 8 TNT around the addon item.
If the 8 TNT all share any addons, the addons will be merged.

## Addons
Name | Crafting Item | Description
--- | --- | ---
Smoke Bomb | campfire or soul campfire | TNT will create a cloud of smoke instead of damaging blocks and entities
Trap | tripwire hook | This TNT will ignite instantly when mined. It can be mined safely with silk touch or shears
Instant | redstone torch | TNT will explode instantly with no fuse
Floating | phantom membrane | When ignited, TNT will float upwards at a constant pace
Dud | water bucket | When ignited, the TNT will drop as an item. It can also be placed by dispensers instead of ignited by dispensers
Proximity | ender eye | Any player within a 5 block area of the TNT block will ignite it. The player who crafted the TNT is ignored
Glowing | glowstone dust | The TNT entity will glow which allows it to be seen through walls
Incendiary | fire charge | Upon exploding, the TNT will produce fire along with breaking blocks. Similar to a ghast fireball
Sticky | slime ball | The TNT entity will stay in place instead of falling downwards
No Block Damage | feather | The TNT won't damage blocks but will still damage mobs
